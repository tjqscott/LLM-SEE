# systematic-review process

First, the full text of the Mohanani et al. (2018) systematic mapping study was reviewed. The 65 identified primary studies were screened—starting with the title, followed by the abstract, and finally a full-text reading where required—to identify papers concerned with Software Effort Estimation (SEE). Sixteen relevant papers were identified. Eight listed Magne Jørgensen as the primary author, with his University of Oslo colleague Kjetil Moløkken on a further four. The remaining four papers were first-authored by Haugen and Løhre (also of Oslo), as well as Abdel-Hamid and Connolly (of California and Arizona, USA, respectively).

The search process outlined in the Mohanani paper was replicated across the five scientific databases. This meant searching for papers with the phrases 'software' and "cognitive bias" in their full text or metadata. This process yielded similar results to the Mohanani paper, with the notable exception of Science direct.

A more in depth reading of the sixteen identified papers revealed that each contained the word estimate or some morphological relative (e.g. estimates, estimating). This fact was used
