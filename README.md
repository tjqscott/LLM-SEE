# systematic-review process

First, the full text of the Mohanani et al. (2018) systematic mapping study was reviewed. The 65 identified primary studies were screened—starting with the title, followed by the abstract, and finally a full-text reading where required—to identify papers concerned with Software Effort Estimation (SEE). Sixteen relevant papers were identified. Eight listed Magne Jørgensen as the primary author, with his University of Oslo colleague Kjetil Moløkken on a further four. The remaining four papers were first-authored by Haugen and Løhre (also of Oslo), as well as Abdel-Hamid and Connolly (of California and Arizona, USA, respectively).

The search process outlined in the Mohanani paper was replicated across the five scientific databases. This meant searching for papers with the phrases 'software' and "cognitive bias" in their full text or metadata, while filtering for english language papers in the field of Computing/ Software. This process yielded similar results to the Mohanani paper, with the notable exception of Science direct. That particular database yielded over 100 fewer results while every other database was within a margin of error. One possible cause for this discrepancy is the Subject areas selector which contains a serperate section for Engineering and Decision Sciences which might not reflect the state of Science direct in 2016, furthermore, it is also possible that large numbers of papers have been removed in the past decade.

A more in depth reading of the sixteen primary studies revealed that each contained the word estimate or some morphological relative (e.g. estimates, estimating) in its abstract. This fact was used to inform the search for modern papers by adding the term 'estim*' as a new search parameter, specifically in the abstract of candidate documents. The '*' character acts as a wildcard, allowing any word starting with 'estim' to satisfy the condition. Unfortunately, Science direct does not support wildcards, so the list: (estimated, estimate, estimates, estimating, estimator, estimation, estimative, estimability) was provided to cover all of the words identified in the primary studies and other potential relatives.
