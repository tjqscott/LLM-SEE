### Type:
- Controlled: Active manipulation of one or more independent variables to measure the change in a dependant variable against a control group.
- Case Study: An in depth analysis of a single subject in a real world setting aiming to describe a phenomenon.
- Correlational: An evaluation of the relationship between two naturally existing variables that can prove a link but not causation.
- Discussion: An exploration of a topic primarily through argumentation and an exploration of the existing literature.
- Quasi-experiment: Comparison of outcomes between pre-existing groups exposed to different experimental conditions.
### Granularity:
- Project level: The time taken to complete an entire project; including software or other projects e.g. a jigsaw puzzle. 
- Story Level: The time taken to implement a user story or other form of requirement or subtask.
### Subject Design:
- Between-subjects: Different groups are given different experimental conditions and the group outcomes are compared. 
- Within-subjects: Each subject is exposed to multiple experimental conditions and individual responses are compared.
### Cognitive Biases:
- Anchoring: The tendency to rely too heavily on the first piece of information offered.
- Over-optimism: The tendency to underestimate the likelihood of negative events or the effort needed to complete a task.
- Over-confidence: The tendency to have too much faith in one's own abilities or knowledge.
- Time limit: The tendency to be overly influenced by a stated time limit in the estimation of task completion time.
- Hindsight: The tendency to retroactively see a process as having been predictable or straightforward.
- Wishful thinking: The tendency to form beliefs based on what is pleasing to imaging rather that strictly on evidence of rationality.
